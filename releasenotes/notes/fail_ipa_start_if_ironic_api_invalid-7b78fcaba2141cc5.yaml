fixes:
  - Accepting ``ipa-api-url`` value specified in the configuration
    file that does not start with either ``https://`` or ``http://``.

    This misconfiguration will be detected on ironic-python-agent start.
    An exception will be raised and an error about the invalid value
    will be logged.
