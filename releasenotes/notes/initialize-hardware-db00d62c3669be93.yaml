features:
  - Add a new hardware manager method "initialize_hardware" which can be
    overriden to provide early oneshot hardware initialization, such as loading
    kernel modules or probing hardware. The generic implementation loads the
    IPMI modules, calls "udev settle" and waits for at least one suitable disk
    to appear in the "lsblk" output.
